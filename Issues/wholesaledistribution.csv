Demo to Tim Farell (ex-Global CIO Grainger),"Please see attached. If we show all these scenarios, I think it will cover majority of cases, if not all. Let me know which day of this week we can go through these. I am available at 8:00 everyday this week.

One question I have is the ability to add products in a standalone Hybris environment. Tim may ask the question to see how easy or hard it is to add the product information in Hybris. Let us go through one scenario on that too when we have the demo for me this week.
---------------------------------------------
Order to Cash scenarios

1.	Customer orders a motor, price the product using standard price, shipping charges, and taxes. Close the order; print the invoice so that it can be mailed to the customer. – Guest Checkout –Amravathi: Santosh, Yugandhar
2.	Customer orders a motor, gets their customer specific price, apply shipping charges and tax, charge the order to their credit card.- Lucky Demo tomorrow
3.	Customer orders several products. The first is a chain saw. When he picks the chain saw, suggest a chain and a pair of gloves (suggestive selling). Pick the chain saw because he wants that but does not pick gloves. Then he orders a GE motor. We don't have that in stock but we have a similar motor from a different manufacturer in stock, add that motor to the cart. Then he wants to order a wrench. We don't have the wrench, it is forecasted to arrive in the shipment in 7 days. Put that on backorder showing that it will be available in 7 days. Customer pays with the credit card. (Backorder-Venky, Gopi)- Demo tomorrow
4.	Ability to release the backorder from scenario 3 above. Close the order at this point with shipping charges and tax, the customer pays with the credit card. (Backorder release in Back office- Venky, Gopi)-Friday
5.	Bring up the order from step 3 (viewing order history). The customer orders two products from that order. Pick those products; close it as an open order for printing and mailing to the customer.-Lucky Demo tomorrow.

I am not thinking about security at the server level - that will be taken care of by the hosting provider. I am thinking about authenticating a user in addition to the e-mail id, phone number, user id and a password. Can you check with your team and see if anybody has any thoughts on how to make authentication more robust?

B2B Order Approval,"Order Approval enables the manual validation and approval of orders placed by a B2B customer both on the customer and on the merchant side. Key components of this process include:

When an order is placed, if the order is within the scope of permissions, e.g. the order is less than the threshold, the order is automatically approved. If the order exceeds the permission, the order is placed in a pending approval state. Eligible order approvers are notified and must manually approve or reject the order.
→ Order Thresholds can be defined on a per-order basis, or cover a time span of weeks or months. An optional permission to exceed the assigned budget can be given to specific B2B customers.
→ To provide customer approval for an order a user must have the B2B Approver role. In addition, he must also have rights which define the monetary limits to which he can approve. The position of the B2B Approver in the hierarchy is used by the Customer Approval Process when finding the least senior B2B Approver permitted to approve an order.
→ If the order exceeds the B2B unit’s credit limit on the merchant’s side it requires additional approval by the assigned Account Manager in the hybris business tools.

Workflow for Purchase Order to supplier when stock reduces after customer placess order,"Jarnail's email-

In the follow up conversation with Tim, he brought up a feature that is really important for us to add. When the customer places an order, the inventory for the product gets depleted by the quantity ordered. The system should be able to create a purchase order which goes to the supplier for replenishing the distributor's inventory. We need to find out whether this feature is available in Hybris or not. In either case, we need to configure/create this feature. Can you call me tomorrow morning at 7:30 CST to discuss this?

Storefront API Key Configuration
The hybris Multichannel Accelerator project is ready to maintain multiple stores and each store can operate at different address. It requires Google Maps API key to be configurable because each key is valid only for one URL. Project contains GoogleAPIKeyInterceptor that is able to hold many references to different API keys and matches proper API key for URL. However to work properly it must be configured using platform  project.properties files. The file can contain multiple entries for different registered URL addresses. Properties file contains data as key to value pairs. Google API key in property file should start with googleApiKey.followed with url that this particular key should match. Here is sample piece of property file for generated google API keys:
googleApiKey.apparel.uk.local=ABQIAAAAv(...)4LmJ7bMEeRQ
googleApiKey.apparel.de.local=ABQIAAAAv(...)Ma6XGgaJvyQ

In Store Locator search results page and store details page distance between point of service and searched location is displayed. Depending on the actual address of the point of sale, distance can be displayed in different units. Currently two different unit systems are supported: metric and imperial. You can assign each country ISO code to be displayed in specific unit system using  project.properties file in the system. Sample entries in  project.properties file may look like this:
acceleratorstorefront.imperial.isocodes=us,gb
acceleratorstorefront.metric.isocodes=de,ja

The distances of countries with ISO codes listed for acceleratorstorefront.imperial.isocodes property key are displayed with imperial units, and countries listed for acceleratorstorefront.metric.isocodes are displayed with metric units. Distances in the system are always calculated in the metric system and the actual ratio for an imperial system is hardcoded in the DistanceHelper helper class.

Order Approval process,"Depending on the configuration of the B2B store, orders may require approval from the customer's organization, from the merchant, or both.
Customer Organization Approval B2B customers are assigned one of the the following ordering permissions:

* The Threshold per order permission limits how much can be spent per order.

* The Threshold per timespan permission limits how much can be spent per day, week, month, quarter, or year.

* The Budget exceeded permission allows customers to exceed an assigned budget.

When an order is placed:
If the order is within the defined threshold for that customer, the order is automatically approved.
If the order exceeds the defined threshold, the order is set to pending. One of the order approvers for that user must approve or reject the order.

The necessary permissions, thresholds, and approver assignments on the customer side are managed by the client's administrators in the My Company page of the storefront. To view, approve, or reject a pending order, the approver uses the Order Approval Dashboard in the storefront's My Account page.

Implement fulfillment algorithm account to minimize the number of shipments,"Hybris offers off the box the basic solutions supporting order management and consignment. 

In our solution can we implement fulfillment algorithm that would take into account the distance between the warehouse and the consumer and minimize the number of shipments ?

For example, the customer wants to purchase twenty large screen TVs. The system has found six TV’s in one of your stores and four in the other. Since we need another ten TV’s our custom algorithm sends a request to a warehouse to order these additional TV sets. As a result – the customer will get a shipment of all twenty items shipped in a least expensive way.

Implement fulfillment algorithm account to minimize the number of shipments,"Hybris offers off the box the basic solutions supporting order management and consignment. 

In our solution can we implement fulfillment algorithm that would take into account the distance between the warehouse and the consumer and minimize the number of shipments ?

For example, the customer wants to purchase twenty large screen TVs. The system has found six TV’s in one of your stores and four in the other. Since we need another ten TV’s our custom algorithm sends a request to a warehouse to order these additional TV sets. As a result – the customer will get a shipment of all twenty items shipped in a least expensive way.
